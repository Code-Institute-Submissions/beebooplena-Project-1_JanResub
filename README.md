# Lunar`s life
This is a site where animal and cat lovers can follow and get updated about the cat Lunar. The written text is the "voice" of Lunar, that reflects over his happenings in his everyday life. This site is a place to give people humour, love and cute pictures of Lunar. Many people are drawned to cats and this site will give a lot of cuteness that people find in cats. Lunar is my own cat and as many cat lovers, I have a lot of pictures of my cat on my phone that I can easily use for Lunar`s site.

## Features
Top of the header is the logo and title Lunar`s life. Below the logo you will find a big close up picture of Lunar with a zooming effect, The picture will show the reader that this is about a cat. I choosed calm colours like light green to make it more nature and relaxing to the eye of the reader.

### Bugs
When I was working with my media queries, I found out that the css I used on my diary page by using top, right and bottom gave me very little control when I needed to change the media queries css for smaller screens. I wanted to have the picture and the text vertically lined when using mobile screens. I tried learning flex-box, but couldn`t make it work. I finally found out that I had to create two new dives and start my css on the diary at the beginning again, so it could give me more control and make it responsive to smaller screens.


### Unfixed Bugs

### Content
* I got inspired from the CL love running project and used the same zoom effect animation with small changes on them. Here is the original zoom animation code from CL love running that I got inspired from:

/* animates zoom effect on loading page*/
animation-name: hero-zoom;
animation-duration: 5s;
animation-fill-mode: forwards; }
/* creates the level of zoom for hero image */

@keyframes hero-zoom {
    from {
        transform: scale(1);
    }
    to {
        transform: scale(1.1);
    }
}

* I also got inspired from the CL love running project to start with this default code to make it easier to use css. Here is the original code from the CL love running project:

*{ margin:0;
padding: 0;
border: none; }

* I used icons from font awesome

* I used coolors.co to find a nice colour palette to my webpage.

* I used youtube as a social media link.

* I imported a font from google font.
### Media
