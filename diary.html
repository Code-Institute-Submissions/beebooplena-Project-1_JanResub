            Dear diary. Today I slept like a log. It seemed as if nothing could wake me from the deepest of slumber. Sadly I was mistaken, as I sensed the presence of my in house photographer, that I hired in order to document my life to you kind people out there. I just wish he could have let me sleep 4-5 hours longer, as I`d only gotten 12 hours of sleep this day. Well, what can I say? It`s hard work being a stay-at-home cat.

            Dear diary. Today I had scheduled a photoshoot in order to get a couple of pictures that shows you just how delightful I can be. I think of pursuing a career as a professional model, you see. This is my sultry «come hither» stare. This one`s for all you lady-cats reading my diary. I see you.
